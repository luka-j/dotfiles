# To make use of this feature, simply uncomment one of the lines below or
# add your own one (see /usr/share/locale/locale.alias for more codes)
# This overwrites the system default set in /etc/sysconfig/language
# in the variable RC_LANG.

#export LANG=de_DE.UTF-8	# uncomment this line for German output
#export LANG=fr_FR.UTF-8	# uncomment this line for French output
#export LANG=es_ES.UTF-8	# uncomment this line for Spanish output
